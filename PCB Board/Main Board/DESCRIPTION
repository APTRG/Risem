<h1>Main Board</h1>
<p> This is the main board of the project <b>RISEM</b>. It has many modules that allow for all the interactions that are needed. These modules are the following:
<ul>
<li><u>USB Connection:</u> The main board needs to be connected to the PC in order to get the Azimuth, Elevation and Frequency.
<br>
<li><u>Motor Controllers:</u> There are two motors in an AzEl Rotor, both of them are stepper motors that need to be controlled individually, for this task the board is equiped with two L297-L298 pairs, which support steppers motors up to 2A.
<br>
<li><u>Serial Connection:</u> The frequency of the Yaesu FT-857D is corrected through the use of a Serial-CAT cable, which transforms the TTL CAT signals of the Yaesu into RS-232 USART signals, in the main board a MAX232 converts the RS-232 signals into TTL signals again, in order to connect the USART module in the PIC to the Yaesu CAT module.
<br>
<li><u>LCD Connection:</u> A requirement for this project is the use of an LCD, this project is designed to support characters displays (16x2 or 16x4) with 5x7 characters.
<br>
<li><u>Programming Header:</u> The board allows to reprogram the PIC whenever there is a firmware update through a programming header.
<br>
<li><u>GPIO:</u> The port A was left unused, this pins are free so they can be used for future extensions.
